I just looked up a bio of Jensen Huang and we share a birthday. I am 11 years his senior. Electronics was my hobby and for the past 25 years I have been helping people with computers and computing as my occupation.
"Well, that was dope."
Jenson is the true visionary leader surpassing his predecessors.
take a shot every time he says AI
Your energy is contagious!
"As a doom thinker, I think that in the best scenario, the very richest (owners of those machines) will be the last people on earth.<br>Machines can produce themselves in mining, agriculture, livestock (still keep those people as live cattle to enforce the last specific jobs?).<br>After that, all these machines will continue 24/7 autonomously in their mining and production of more machines.<br>(Sun)light is no longer necessary because machines do not need to see each other through light waves and living material is not necessary or useful. The machines are now smart enough to (re)create any material synthetically. (They are AI smart enough for that). Are the raw materials almost gone.....<br>Then possibly into space in search of more material to multiply themselves. They do not need oxygen anyway. Energy from space in any form is infinitely available to continue.<br>You could then say that we are the dinosaurs of our time.... oh, wait..... there is no more &#39; we&#39; :)"
"Hey I know him! That guy&#39;s the reason I have to spend $1,000 on a GPU just to play new games!"
He said we Discovered AI not invented
She talks instead of listening
Damn I did not know that Keira Knightley was into technology.
"Jensen, You are worth respect!!"
Tell him to lower  the price of his d*mn gpu
Cleo is my new favourite person to explain things to me.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ARBJQn6QkM&amp;t=660"">11:00</a>"
We need more people like Cleo in this world and making content. Always leave after watching a Cleo video happier and more enthusiastic about life and the world.

"&quot;Pushing&quot; around a lawnmower is something someone who never mowed a lawn would say. You have to angle it, lift it, slam it against the walls of your house, over stumps, around rocks. Robots are not gonna be better at that than people ever. You would need to change what a lawnmower is to be more precise and efficient than aimed destruction, like a swarm of knife bees."

"Such an amazing video, alot of useful information."
Is anyone else against AI here or are you all down without questioning it whatsoever ? Because we barely know wgat tge full capacity of our human brains are capable of. You would think before we make something in our image that we&#39;d understand ourselves a bit better. Don&#39;t you think ? Or do you not bother thinking at all !!!
"Everything that moves will be AI. 🤔 Now wgo would want this aside from people who are ritch assholes. Lets see, nobody !!! Your literally going to kill the human race with something that will replace us. Yet you don&#39;t even understand what our minds are fully capable of,yet your willing to see how far a metallic, structured,high functioning,self functioning machine which can speak and think for itself. You&#39;re all idiots !!! Read the book 1984 by George Orwell And watch all<br>The Terminator movies. Welcome to what could exclusively be your future."
i disliked the video. it&#39;s a shame that interviewer decided to ask such silly abstract questions
"AI is a misnomer.  You can&#39;t be intelligent and Artificial.  Any AI depends on a programmer, and that means that it&#39;s NOT artificial, it&#39;s intentional and human based."
"Cool, I&#39;m 62 this year, I first experienced PC&#39;s in the early 1980&#39;s, where games were wire frames or monochrome colours and very 2D. Compared to what we have now it is amazing. I am into PC gaming and PC VR, to do what we do today in just 45 years is beyond what I imagined in the 80&#39;s. I balance my video gaming with real life activities, getting outside, riding motorcycles and sidecars. I think it is important to mix both."
Doesn&#39;t she evoke that Jemma Simmons from The Agents of Shield vibe?
"He is living 50 years ahead of our time. Incredible person , visioner and a good person! Respect. NVIDA to the moon!"
"looking forward to the day when artificial organs can be manifested and can be a substitute for real organs, which could further be integrated with humanoid."
really because of you cleo my brain is coming with endless possibilities for day by day after watching your video im really gratfull to you thank you for makin this video . ok how do you just call a ceo of a big tech company for the interview as a youtuber . and lastly your videos are my favorite because all topics of your videos are kind of my interests so personally very very thank you
"Oh, look. Totally not psy*th is talking and I want to hear him out. I want to not that you want to force him down my throat and stuff. Oh, look. YouTube recommendations are totally random and stuff. <br><br>If he had talked you wouldn&#39; recommend him. He&#39;s moving up to my A list for the deal if you wanted to take the deal. I keep moving people from my C to B list and B to A list. Because you keep recommending them meaning not only they didn&#39;t talk. They clearly lied."
I just realized human dna might just be a learning model that evolved over thousands of years of training in a simulation...
Love it!!
Does anyone think that she looks like keira knightley? how can a person be so beautiful and intelligent??? T.T
Really impressive preparation and. Asking questions we want to know the answers to....bloody excellent interview
thanks for destroying our future!!!!
"Jensen Huang is truly a visionary leader! His insights into AI, GPUs, and accelerated computing are shaping the future of technology."
"But then it Becomes Super Villians The Humans just like with internet and No Super Hero Shows Up! In reality Bat Wayne Account Becomes  Lex Luther not Bat But Cobra. Who had the Two Faces? I beat that Arkham Game. This Could Be Fun for a Short Time but humans tire need rest. Fully simulated Data can be reRun again. A Robo Bat Trap Runs All Night without a Glitch. We wake up in 1984 Arkham Enlisted&gt;Damn Terminator Was too Intelligent and it was all Artificial Simulated in seconds. Marvel Did the Mutant MasterMold AI Sentinel Program. Boo Watch They Used My Doom Saved Game Meta Data Program on the Super Robot. Imagine A Future Hack that jacked everything up but it was awesome. Should Make a Video Game of it.  Warping the Future in a GPU visual 4k view. I can&#39;t wait for the New ARM NS2 Portable Game Plays. Super Mario Knocking out Terminators, ED-209 and Bowers reptiles."
"Amazing video! Cleo, you absolutely killed that interview have&#39;t been this immerse in a very long time"
What does psychology say about someone who doesn&#39;t blink?
"👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏<br>Thanks, this was inspiring and very informative interview."

"How does NVIDIA feel about taking contracts from apartheid/genocidal Israel?  There&#39;s extensive documentation about Israel&#39;s abuse of AI to slaughter Palestinians.  How will aiding/abetting Israeli war crimes effect this company &amp; its reputation? We know facebook, google, microsoft have also gotten multi-million $ contracts to develop AI for Israel to kill Palestinians.  Yes, we know Israel&#39;s blanket statement is about killing Hamas, but in reality, 80% of Palestinians murdered are children and women. What is NVIDIA going to do to ensure that its technology won&#39;t be abused to kill people?"

"Does huang have a nobel? If if not, wtf are they doing not awarding one to him"
Rtx GFX powering two microphones to give us a bliss interview is awesome inspiring 😂😂😂😅
Dst uzb 😊 Olğa omdaiz bersinlar.
"Jensen Huang, a Great man.. a very important gentleman. Thank you Cleo for this huge interview. Thanx to him &amp; his company My RTX 3060 was rendering you guys the whole time. 🙂"
👍
Tell him to make the 5090s more available
🎉
Hype is dying he has gotta do something
"I think the dark side of all these AI innovation  if you&#39;re not aware or knowledgeable about AI. So, education about this new innovation is vital."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ARBJQn6QkM&amp;t=2810"">46:50</a> can I sample this?"
I love how she just casually  meets the C.E.O of like one of the biggest tech companies.
❤❤jesen work for us
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ARBJQn6QkM&amp;t=179"">2:59</a> that’s me by the way I’m not 12 I’m nine"
Great interview 👍
"God, shes good!! Omg.... shes sooooo good, God tier good. <br>Omg, sooooo good!!! ❤❤❤❤"
does speaking so fast make her podcast some kind of elite something? its not talking about its speed of her speaking sheeeeet
"This might be the biggest oof of all time. Gaming is literally in its worst state... ever. They are price gouging the lowly &quot;gamer.&quot; Also, Jensen flat out lied about it in front of everyone. &quot;AI&quot; is being used for ONLY money gaining purposes built on the backbone of billions of creative and intelligent people WITHOUT their consent.<br><br>I&#39;m a career programmer. I know exactly what they are doing. I even know the nuts and bolts at a binary level. Even assembly. Parallel processing has existed for 45 years. All Nvidia is doing is making something that drains power for the same reason. It&#39;s destroying people&#39;s lives with the only motivation being money."
Building a great weather model ……. We’ll want to have a digital twin of the solar system and all heat and cold sources simulated to figure out which direction winds will blow…. Get this right and the rest will follow I think.
Jensen Huang is not from Japan.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ARBJQn6QkM&amp;t=3570"">59:30</a> dark lol Jenson made it darker mentioning the tombstone  😂"
😮
There are probably only a handful content creators who provide value as much as Cleo does
"It was stupid of me to sell $76,000 worth of NVDA stocks without reinvesting. (Buying bonds or CDs is not for me). I’d rather stay 100% cash, or are there any other investments that can outdo the growth of Nvidia? I have 200k ready to be reinvested"
She talk more than him     😅😅😅😅😅... crazy
"An hour with an interviewer that just can&#39;t stop talking. Pratiling on about how good she is going to be and how she is better then the rest, so that this guy who came here to talk  can&#39;t get a word in.  She really admires her look, her sound, her whole package that is her."
Are people vehicles for change? Who takes out the trash?
"Sometimes, you have the ability to do something , but that doesn’t mean you should. Beyond making a profit, you need to consider the consequences, pros, and cons. If your innovation is harmful, would you still pursue it?"
Do you not have heat in that studio? Must be like 20°f in there
You should make a robot that can win all Olympic disciplines; that would be a momentous achievement.
Interstate highways were created for military purposes...<br>AI is being created for the same reason...<br>AI is already being shown that it makes people less intelligent...

Please Dube in Hindi and show this rejult men&#39;s your view like a 90M...

Is it true that she died ?
Why are the GPUs the most expensive ? 😅
Nice interview! amazing
Are they both wearing leather jackets? 😎
shovels all the way down.
What a career milestone Cleo! <br><br>Great conversation and way to convert your passion and energy through your questions and delivery. <br><br>Keep it up!
Have you asked him when will he stop ducking charging 5000$ for a graphics card?

"This is all very exciting information but right now most of the research is contributing towards the self interest of each company promoting tech with a huge price tag. Can we get more realistic examples of how these new tech can be used in everyday life in the near future that will be able to help out even the least fortunate countries, with affordable prices which will help increase the happiness and well being of individuals and communities."
"Just a matter of time when everyone has to realize the decades worth of predatory data monetization of kids under 18 that couldn&#39;t consent if they wanted to.  Maybe the first trillion dollar class action. Will it be Google, or nvidia or meta...who knows. But every LLM is corrupted at the core."
"I agree. Just because there are opportunities doesn&#39;t mean we should dive in without caution. We should look for market analysis or guidance, or seek advice from certified market strategists."
can&#39;t wait for all the april fools quantum style adverts haha i swear it will become the new AI ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai type thing that everyone is talking about lol
Was it just me or did anyone else notice the psychopathic look in his eyes when he said &quot;everything that moves will be robotic someday&quot;?
"Chloe, I might not be an engineer. But YOU MIGHT be in for a surprise as to what I am making. It&#39;s not a device or any electronics, but BOY does it align with the genre of your channel on a macroscopic level ;)"
"Jensen Huang, stop lying and repair your RTX 50 series graphic cards."
"Rise of Super IA, and dumb humans."
"Jensen, Hedge funds are trying to short and push down the price of your stock since the last earning release … need you to show growth sustainability beyond 2025 and widening of the range of customers for your top GPUs (more diversified revenue base), and why gross/profit margins will only gradually come down."
Hi Cleo - Hey do you have this in a podcast so I can listen that way? Why did the &#39;C&#39; chicken cross the road? because dinosaurs were extinct ;)
"Mastery of Human-AI synergy is understanding that recursive learning is a two-way street. If you buy prompt spreadsheets online and learn prompt engineering, you are removing your own voice from the equation..the same voice that the models are fine-tuned to hone in on and tailor their approach to in real time. Just be yourself with it"

Isn&#39;t this an incredible time to be alive! When dreams become reality .
